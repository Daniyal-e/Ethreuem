# Ethreuem
 Ethereum Price History API This project is a simple Flask-based web API that fetches Ethereum (ETH) price history over the past 30 days using the Yahoo Finance API (yfinance package). The API is designed to allow external applications, such as a React frontend, to access real-time Ethereum price data.  Features: Flask Backend: A RESTful API built with Flask to serve Ethereum price data. Yahoo Finance Integration: Uses the yfinance library to fetch the historical closing prices of Ethereum (ETH) for the last 30 days. CORS Support: Configured with Flask-CORS to allow cross-origin requests from a React frontend or any other external clients. API Endpoints: GET /api/eth-price: Fetches Ethereum (ETH) closing price history for the past 30 days in JSON format.
